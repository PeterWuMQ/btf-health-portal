## APPLICATION OUTLINE

Due to the changing social and work conditions caused by COVID-19, there is a growing concern over the rapid decline of employee mental health. During these challenging conditions, it is important that individuals are provided with proper access to support. As such, this mental health portal was created with the goal of assisting individuals in detecting the potential early signs of poor mental health, and providing them with appropriate support services.

## MVP IMPLEMENTATION

The goal of the MVP was to create a digital questionnaire that would allow users to assess their mental health and be provided with a list of tailored help services, based on the users preferences.

#### Questionnaire:

The DASS- 21 Questionnaire Page consists of 21 questions that help to identify whether the user may be at risk of having poor mental health.
This is implemented in QuestionnairePage.js, it uses QuestionList, Question, NormalButton components.

#### Result Sharing:

Users will be able to share their DASS-21 Results. Users may choose to either share their results via email, or by downloading a copy.

This is implemented in ResultPage.js, it uses NormalTable, NormalButton components. It implements sharing functions with third-party libraries emailjs-com and react-to-pdf.

#### Direct Questions:

The Direct Questions Page presents the user with 9 questions that help to filter out a list of services tailored to them.

This is implemented in DirectQuestionsPage.js, it uses QuestionList, NormalButton components.

#### Services:

The Services Page provides the user with a list of services, based on their answers on the Direct Questions Page.

This is implemented in RecommendationsPage.js, it uses NormalTable, NormalButton components.
